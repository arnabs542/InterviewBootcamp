/*
Comments :
Design an 'efficient' simple dictionary, that can be accessed by multiple
concurrent users and editors simultaneosly. While the users are looking up for
definitions of specific words, the editors are either creating defintions for
new words, or updating the ones for existing words. There are many more
users(Readers) of the dictionary  than there are editors.
