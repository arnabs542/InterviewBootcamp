/*
Comments :
Use a semaphore to implement a bounded hash set (or any collection for that
matter), a set that provides additional semantics of a blocking bounded
collection to the underlying set.
Note: the semaphore is initialized to the desired "bound" for the collection.
The underlying set implementation knows nothing about the bound.
